Player 1 and player 2 need to have different user names and markers. The length of user names and markers are not restricted. 
A human player can have a user name called "Computer". When he/she plays against a computer, the game would show whether this human
won or not. For example, if you see the game result is "Computer won the game", that means a human player with user name "Computer" 
won this game.
The computer (the machine) will have a marker "O" (the uppercase letter O, not zero).
If a human player chooses "O", the the marker for the computer would be "X"

Players need to enter row number and column number (with a white space in between) to make a move.

A player can enter as many invalid moves as they want within the time limit.

Players can quit the game at any time by entering Quit (case insensitive. Players can restart a new game after they finish the current game.
